title: Canvassing Jenzabar with the Crunch Society
---
# Crunch Society
## The Beginning
Starting in September of 2018, I started working as an intern with the software development team for Southern Virginia University. This team is refered to as the Crunch Society for reasons that no one seems to know. I joined the team right before they started a large project, integrating Canvas with Jenzabar.  
Southern Virginia uses Jenzabar, a student information system, and just started using Canvas, a learning management system. Our job was to take the two systems and make them talk to each other. In particular, we need each system to update correctly when changes are made in the other system.

## What I Have Learned
### Project Management
We started with project management, which I hadn't ever done before. We took the user stories that my boss had written with the various stakeholders, and added others that we felt were necessary. With user stories in place, and an understanding of the general structure of the entire project, we set up our first sprint.

### C#

### Visual Studio and VS Code

### Hitting an API

### Azure DevOps
I'm learning how to use [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/). If you were wondering, that was me testing adding a link.

### Version Control

### Dependency Injection

### Repository Stuff

### Markdown

This is going to be a place that I continue to update for a while with different things that I learn while with the Crunch Society.
